CocoaGit
==========
CocoaGit is an implementation of git using Objective-C and the Mac OS X Foundation Framework. It began as an experiment and learning experience into both Objective-C development and the internals of git and grew into what it is now.

Current State of Development
-----------------------------
Development on my part (geoffgarside) has halted. If you would like to take over on this project then send me a message and I'll add a note to this README about where active development is taking place.

I have personally begun beating the anvil again with [Git.framework][gitframework] and will direct most of my attention there. At the moment I've only recently made [Git.framework][gitframework] publicly available. It presently only features local reading of repositories through a much smaller API than CocoaGit, though as time goes by it will adopt the features of this project and will eventually surpass it.
